## Core Features:

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#303F9F) for a professional and trustworthy feel.

- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight key information and interactive elements, and to complement the dark blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear readability and a modern look.
- Use a grid-based layout to arrange stock 'cards', ensuring a balanced and responsive design.
- Employ minimalist icons to represent stock-related concepts (e.g., trends, categories) to enhance visual understanding.
- No animations; this is a static display.
